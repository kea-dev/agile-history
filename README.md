### Exercise 1 : Create a personal markdown file

Use the online editor on GitHub _(Code >> Add file >> Create new file)_ to create e new file in the _root_ of the repository. Make the file personal simply by naming it after your GitHub handle with an `.md`  _file extension_.

Your handle is you login name. My handle on GitHub is [@lakruzz](https://github.com/lakruzz) so my file will be `lakruzz.md`.

Add two lines to the file:

```markdown
# Lars Kruse
## lakruzz
```

First line is your name (First + Last) preceded with a hash (#) and separated with a space.
Second line is your GitHub handle preceded with two hashes (##) and also separated with a space.

Commit the file!

```markdown
Go back into your file `<handle>.md` and add some `MarkDown`. It shall include:

- [x] A level 1 header with your full name.
- [x] A level 2 header with your GitHub handle.
- [ ] An image (of yourself - preferably).
- [ ] A bulleted list of things you are currently working on.
- [ ] A prioritized list of Programming languages and technologies you wanna work with.
- [ ] A link to all your public repositories on GitHub.
- [ ] Your GMail (if you have more, than just the one you'd like to use for sharing documents).
- [ ] A short description of what you dream of working with - two years from now - when you graduate and enter the labour market as a full-fledged, full-time software developer.

Also make sure:

- [ ] Assign this issue to yourself
- [ ] Commit the file when you are done
- [ ] As you progress with the items on the list - come back to this issue and check out the items.

```

With theCode snippet above in your clip board create a new issue in this repository

    - Title: **"&lt;Your name&gt;'s file"**
    - Content: Dump the content of the clipboard (the code below)
    - Assign: Assign the issue to yourself.
    - Submit: Save the issue

TEST by wisiting [github.com/issues](https://github.com/issues) - do you see your new issue? If not _did you assign it to yourself?_
